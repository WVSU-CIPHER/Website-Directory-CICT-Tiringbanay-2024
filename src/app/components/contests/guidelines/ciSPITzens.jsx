            All team members, including faculties, are allowed to join the game.

            and Madam Kahel, chosen randomly through the fishbowl method.
          </li>
          <li>
            The audience will provide the word or question on the spot depending
            on which category they get. It can be in English, Tagalog, or
            Hiligaynon. Questions should be appropriate and comprehensive, and
            vulgar words are strictly prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each team will have at least one (1) minute to strategize for the
            category they receive.

          <li>Each team will have two (2) minutes to perform the improv.</li>
          <li>
            The Ranking System will determine the winners, based on the highest
            Percentage Score. In the case of a tie, the official tabulators will
            use the Point System, and if deadlock persists, the Chief Judge will
            have the authority to decide.
          </li>
          <li>The decision of the judges is final and irrevocable.</li>
