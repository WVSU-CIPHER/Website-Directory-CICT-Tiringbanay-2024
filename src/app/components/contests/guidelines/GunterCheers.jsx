        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Every team is encouraged to participate in the cheers and yells;
            failure to do so will result in no points awarded for this activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants’ entry must adhere to the overall theme of Tiringbanay
            2024: “A Shift in Reality”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each team must create their own cheers & yells that must NOT exceed
            two (2) minutes. For every ten (10) seconds of overtime, there will
            be a three (3) point deduction from the overall score in cheers &
            yells.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams must ensure that their cheers and yells are free from vulgar,
            offensive, or inappropriate language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Props are allowed, provided that they are biodegradable and
            non-hazardous. Participants must ensure the area is clean after
            their performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants may wear improvised costumes, as long as the costumes
            are relevant to the theme of Tiringbanay 2024: “A Shift in Reality”
            and do not shame, discriminate, or disrespect any culture, religion,
            illness, gender, or sexual orientation. Violators will face a five
            (5) point deduction from their overall score.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams must avoid using props that create excessively loud noises
            (e.g., cauldrons, horns, drums), as these can distract the audience.
            Violators will incur a three (3) point deduction from their overall
            score.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stunts that may cause injury are NOT allowed. Teams who violate this
            rule will be automatically disqualified from the activity.
